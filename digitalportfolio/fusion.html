        <h4><p>Fusion is the process of 2 smaller atoms combining to form 1 larger atom. <br> Atoms can combine only under extreme high temperatures, where atoms are moving so much that they smash into eachother, forming bigger atoms. <br> With more protons and neutrons, and more electrons as well.</p></h4>
