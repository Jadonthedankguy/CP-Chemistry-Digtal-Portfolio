        <h4 id="aboutfusion"><p>Fusion is the process of 2 smaller atoms combining to form 1 larger atom. <br> Atoms can combine only under extreme high temperatures, where atoms are moving so much that they smash into eachother, forming bigger atoms. <br> With more protons and neutrons, and more electrons as well. This naturally only happens inside of the core of stars, but it can be created artificially if you were to heat hydrogen to 100 million degrees kelvin.</p></h4>
