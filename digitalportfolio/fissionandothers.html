            <h1>Fission</h1>
            <h4><p>Fission is a form of radioactive decay, or decay of an atom. <br>Rather than most radioactive decay which happens over a long time. Fission can happen in seconds.</p></h4>
            <h4><p>Fission occurs when a neutron is thrown at an unstable isotope of an atom, or the number of neutrons, such as helium 13;<br> Or Uranium - 235.</p></h4>
            <h4><p>Fission splits the atom in half, creating 2 new identical elements, and releasing a huge amount of energy in the process.</p></h4>
            <h4><p>Fission can happen anywhere, even inside stars. Inside stars they are very much less of the mass of the star, but some heavy elements are made. Some even radioactive!</p></h4>

            <h1>Alpha Radioactive Decay</h1>
            <h4><p>Alpha Radioactive Decay, or just Alpha Decay occurs over time to Radioactive elements/Unstable Elements.</p></h4>
            <h4><p>Alpha Decay occurs over a short period of time rather than seconds with fission.</p></h4>
            <h4><p>Alpha Decay releases alpha particles, which contain 2 proton, and 2 neutrons from the original atom, which changes the element and the isotope as well.</p></h4>
        </div>
        <div id="betadecay">
            <h1>Beta Radioactive Decay</h1>
            <h4><p>Unlike Alpha Decay and Fission, Beta Radioactive Decay takes thousands of years to occur. <br> Beta Decay over thousands of years releases an electron and a antineutrino, making the neutron into a proton, changing the element and changing the charge of the atom a little bit. <br> Depending on the electron amount in the atom, this could make it into an positively charged ion, or make it neutrally charged, or even make it a negatively charged ion.</p></h4>
